# COMP3010 – BOTSv3 Incident Analysis

## Introduction

This report documents a security incident investigation conducted using the Boss of the SOC v3 (BOTSv3) dataset within Splunk. BOTSv3 simulates realistic enterprise log data across network, endpoint, and cloud environments, allowing analysts to practise real-world Security Operations Centre (SOC) workflows.

The purpose of this investigation is to analyse selected security events, identify indicators of suspicious or malicious activity, and demonstrate how a SOC analyst would approach detection, investigation, and response. The scope of this report focuses on one guided question set from the BOTSv3 dataset, supported by Splunk search queries, screenshots, and analysis.

## SOC Roles and Incident Handling Reflection
In a real-world Security Operations Centre (SOC), incident handling is typically organised across multiple tiers, each with distinct responsibilities. Tier 1 analysts are responsible for continuous monitoring and initial triage of alerts, identifying potential security incidents based on log data and predefined detection rules. Tier 2 analysts perform deeper investigation, correlating events across multiple data sources to confirm malicious activity and determine impact.

The BOTSv3 dataset reflects these SOC workflows by providing diverse log sources that require investigation, correlation, and contextual understanding. This investigation aligns primarily with Tier 1 and Tier 2 SOC responsibilities, focusing on detection, analysis, and initial response rather than long-term remediation or threat hunting.
